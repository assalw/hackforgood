deals with all necessities to carry out the field part of the study Some hints for the field realities of implementing a Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey Some hints for the field realities of implementing a Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey 1 Preparations 1 Preparations Before the field part of the survey ask for details from the local team and if possible visit a likely survey location to see the layout structure density etc and adapt plans training to the setting if needed Before the field part of the survey ask for details from the local team and if possible visit a likely survey location to see the layout structure density etc and adapt plans training to the setting if needed For cluster allocation ask the local team to confirm add or cancel villages clusters and population figures in the planned catchment area For cluster allocation ask the local team to confirm add or cancel villages clusters and population figures in the planned catchment area Make sure all villages are included in the catchment area before allocating the clusters Make sure all villages are included in the catchment area before allocating the clusters To define the start of the recall period ask the local team to find a memorable date within the time range that you are interested in that virtually every adult will know new year religious feasts such as Christmas or end of Ramadan election days or independence day are usually well known days To define the start of the recall period ask the local team to find a memorable date within the time range that you are interested in that virtually every adult will know new year religious feasts such as Christmas or end of Ramadan election days or independence day are usually well known days Check with the MSF person who is responsible for security in the field about all security constraints in the catchment area If needed you may exclude selected clusters for security reasons and replace them with the nearest village that is safe to go to Check with the MSF person who is responsible for security in the field about all security constraints in the catchment area If needed you may exclude selected clusters for

      "Step by Step Guide to carry out a Knowledge Attitude and Practice KAP survey for bednet use in a MSF catchment area HypothesisThe guideline starts with the assumption that the need to carry out a Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey in an area where MSF is working was entirely discussed with all decision makers at headquarters and field level Moreover it was agreed to perform the Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey in order to better evaluate the health status of the population living in the MSF catchment area While this type of monitoring is a priority in complex emergencies it is equally important in ongoing healthcare programmes as it provides valuable information that allows MSF to assess existing programmes and guide interventions Knowledge Attitude and Practice surveys may also be done to contribute to a specific advocacy plan or strategy Stage 1 writing a concept paperWrite a concept paper that includes the problem relevance objectives hypothesis and sub hypotheses main background brief literature review methods rough collaboration budget risks to participants and to study completion and study area of the proposed Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey A concept paper template is provided in the annex part of this document Feedback and comments to the concept paper should be sought both at field and headquarters level The concept paper needs to be approved by the Medical Director before moving on to stage 2 Stage 2 writing the study protocol making a study budgetWrite the study protocol A very detailed template of a study protocol to carry out Knowledge Attitude and Practice surveys is provided in this document To benefit from the study as much as possible it is recommended to add only a few specific objectives and thus a few questions in the questionnaire that go beyond the coverage part of the survey Please do not overload the KAP questionnaire with too many questions Around 20 minutes is an acceptable duration for interviews Feedback and comments to the study protocol should be sought both at field and headquarters level The Medical Director should review the study protocols as well It is also important to involve local researchers and or Ministry of Health staff in the country where the study is located from the beginning In any case the Ministry of Health of the country where the study will take place needs to be informed as early as possible of the study and its objectives Make a study budget and revise it on a regular basis A budget template is provided in the annex part of this document On average Knowledge Attitude and Practice surveys cost around EUR 2000 to EUR 4000 Stage 3 Implementation of the study in the fieldChapter 11 of the study protocol deals with all necessities to carry out the field part of the study Some hints for the field realities of implementing a Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey 1 Preparations Before the field part of the survey ask for details from the local team and if possible visit a likely survey location to see the layout structure density etc and adapt plans training to the setting if needed For cluster allocation ask the local team to confirm add or cancel villages clusters and population figures in the planned catchment area Make sure all villages are included in the catchment area before allocating the clusters To define the start of the recall period ask the local team to find a memorable date within the time range that you are interested in that virtually every adult will know new year religious feasts such as Christmas or end of Ramadan election days or independence day are usually well known days Check with the MSF person who is responsible for security in the field about all security constraints in the catchment area If needed you may exclude selected clusters for security reasons and replace them with the nearest village that is safe to go to Make sure you have the equipment needed to maintain security while being in the field radios in the cars handsets mobiles satellite phone etc and be sure you know how to handle the equipment Refresh your memory on the international radio alphabet if necessary Plan your field work around market days and if possible any community wide events e g large weddings and funerals In order to be sure that the study population in the selected villages is present on the day of the planned interviews it is highly recommended to inform them one to maximum two days prior to the interview day of the arrival of the study team This can be easily organised with the help of motor drivers taking information letters to the head of the village and asking him to request that the village population stay at home the day of the field study It is recommended to ask the motor drivers for a confirmation of receipt of the letter by the head of the village Discuss with the MSF person who is responsible for administration and human resources all practical issues e g number of days to be worked mode of payment whether overtime is paid who provides water or empty bottles who pays for lunch who provides gum boots and rain gear who will do the final payment is an advance paid after the training etc The easiest is to pay study staff interviewers as daily workers and that the payment includes the money for water and food i e everybody is responsible for their own food and water Check language level of study staff interviewers and whether there is a need to translate forms and guidelines Keep the study staff interviewers at least the team leaders informed of what you are doing for example if doing focus group discussions after the main survey but only using a few of the team let everyone know Training certificates can be well valued at the end of the study check with the MSF person who is responsible for administration and human resources if this is possible Check with the MSF medical responsible in the field about the referral practices when finding sick people while being in the study villages 2 Training Start the training with practical issues most important is the payment as it can be quite distracting for people if this is not clear Mention the study conditions the one you have discussed with the MSF admin HR person in the field and let everybody decide if they agree to work with these conditions Check with the study staff interviewers that they are available for the entire study no other commitments planned Give a guide to behaviour in the field based on advice of national staff e g how to dress in order to be accepted by participants Make sure study staff interviewers know they cannot bring their children with them during the survey Use flip charts and diagrams Ask lots of questions and let the study staff interviewers answer Explain at a very basic level Reduce the theoretical part to a minimum and focus on practicing the tasks to be done in the study Use role plays Do lots of practice examples to ensure everybody has understood his her task Do a lot of repetitions on the second day of training but also at the beginning of every study day Go through how numbers should be written shape left to right decimal points in numbers date format Create a clear events calendar during the recall period with the input of the study staff interviewers Explain how to use a random number table Do practice scenarios and a pilot enter pilot data straight away to detect problems as soon as possible SMART software highlights things quickly Discuss how to deal with Temporary household members and visitors when to include and when not An empty house and the definition of empty head of household won t come back that evening Be specific about recording this because you need to know this when reviewing data If there are too many empty houses more than 30 in a cluster the cluster may be invalid and need to be re done Newborn deaths need to be included versus stillborns do not include Big estate or apartment where many people live in one building 2 clusters in 1 location the easiest is to divide this location into two roughly equal parts and sample from each Have a clear definition of household see survey protocol Go through lots of examples with the group on what is or is not a household Make sure that they understand that only one person in a household is still a separate household and needs to be included in the study Observe the study staff interviewers constantly during the first day of training At the end of the first day of training and before the pilot study you need to select the different study teams ideally mix weaker with stronger interviewers mix gender and possibly mix ethnicity The study teams should remain in the same composition until the field part of the study is finalised the only time you can reassemble a study team is after the pilot study once the field part of the study has started it is highly recommended that the same study teams should work together every day Make sure that the study teams work as a group and do not separate from each other there might be the tendency to split and work one by one in order to finish the questionnaires in the villages quicker Make sure you have a spare person in the study team in case one of the study team gets sick or needs to drop out Make sure everybody in the study team knows about the referral practices when finding sick people in the study villages 3 In field practicalities Pencils are better than pens in dusty conditions and for corrections Make sure you have pencil sharpeners Visit the head of village immediately after arrival in the village and explain to him the purpose of the study if the head of the village is absent ask to speak to his assistant or well respected elder people before starting to search the first household for the day Be very clear with everybody in the study village that no incentives for answering questions are given and the selection is entirely random Point out that no names are taken during the interviews therefore no registers index of names will be produced for later food or non food item distributions If a village volunteer is offered by the head of the village this can be helpful however Be clear that this person will not be paid or given any incentive Check with the study staff interviewers if head of households might be uncomfortable to answer all the questions in the presence of this village volunteer negative bias If possible temporarily mark e g with chalk coloured cord the houses that have been visited 4 Supervision As principal investigator have an assistant from the local MSF team with you at all times usually this person will be your translator at the same time this is good for capacity building and essential when dealing with security problems Supervise the field part of the study throughout As carrying out interviews is tiring work especially when it is hot or raining study teams can be tempted to cut corners Be available to immediately answer any questions e g by phone or radio in case the study teams find a situation they are unsure about and or it was not predicted during the training Visit each study team at least once during the day without letting them know the exact time of the visit Check the record forms that were completed during the study day every evening in the presence of the study teams for consistency and clarity and give feedback to each study team If there are unusual numbers high or low verify with the study teams whether this could be an error Ask the teams every day if anything unexpected happened and what they did about it STAGE 4 Analysis report writing DisseminationIdeally data entry should be done by the principal investigator who will perform the analysis and was constantly present supervising the field part of the study This will reduce data cleaning to check for inconsistencies in data entry and responses to a minimum time A report template is provided in the annex part of this document which might help to structure the results and not to forget relevant chapters such as the limitations of the study A draft report should be sent for comments and feedback both to the field and headquarters The final report should take into account these comments The report should be distributed to all people involved in the study such as Ministry of Health the study population with a plain language short summary for the community or in poster format for display in the health clinic and the different ethics committees Do not forget the advocacy department they might be very interested in the results of the report but also of photos that were taken during the field part of the study provided that people gave permission for their photograph to be used
