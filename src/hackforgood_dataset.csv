ART improves rates of morbidity and mortality in PLHIV, however it is unclear whether nutritional interventions to improve weight/BMI prior to, or at, ART initiation will improve subsequent clinical outcomes.  This review aims to examine data, to assess the effects of nutritional interventions on outcomes in PLHIV.  Twenty-one articles were included in this review, the quality of the studies included ranges from medium to weak.  Results show the overall quality of existing evidence to be weak across five outcomes; mortality, morbidity, retention in care, quality of life, and/or prevention of ongoing HIV transmission.  The data is deemed inconclusive with regards to the impact of NACS programming on all five outcomes of interest and that significant knowledge and research gaps remain.

To what extent, if at all, is any information on the sexual and reproductive rights of women and girls and the rights of persons with disabilities available in accessible formats?  Are health care professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel, given any training on treating women with disabilities and the human rights of women and persons with disabilities? Are women and girls with disabilities offered screenings for breast cancer, HIV and other STIs, and other preventative health care screenings on an equal basis with nondisabled women and girls? Has the state undertaken any awareness-raising campaigns about the rights of persons with disabilities in the context of parenting or sexual and reproductive health and rights, with the aim of overcoming stigma about disability and tackling discrimination?  accountABILITY: Using U.N.

Standards on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Women and Girls with Disabilities Using this Briefing Paper accountABILITY: Using U.N. Human Rights Mechanisms to Advance the Rights of Women and Girls with Disabilities General Comments/Recommendations Concluding Observations Individual Complaints Together, these three types of documents make up the “jurisprudence” of the treaty body.  By looking at this jurisprudence, we can better understand what types of actions violate international human rights standards and what governments must do to meet their international legal obligations. When we can demonstrate that treaty bodies have previously interpreted international human rights obligations in a way that supports what we are saying, we are more persuasive, treaty bodies may be more likely to take up our issues, and they may provide better guidance to governments on how they can remedy the issues that we raise. Advocates can use this briefing paper to identify what one or more treaty bodies have said on an issue in the past to help frame or describe specific human rights violations in their advocacy.  For each standard or recommendation outlined here, the briefing paper also footnotes the original source(s) for the issues discussed.  Advocates can cite to these original sources to help support their interpretation of a particular human rights obligation.  Although the majority of citations in this briefing paper include all identified instances where a treaty monitoring body addresses a specific issue, there are a few instances where the volume of similar concluding observations on a given topic is too large to cite to each instance; in these cases, the footnotes instead include a set of representative citations from different years and regions.  When engaging in country-specific advocacy, we recommend that advocates always check concluding observations from each treaty body for that particular country.  This information can be found through the website of the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights ( see  accountABILITY These gaps provide opportunities for the treaty bodies to strengthen their jurisprudence and ensure that their interpretations of the legal standards respond to the specific issues that women and girls with disabilities face.  We encourage advocates to consider this discussion of the gaps in legal standards as an invitation to raise these issues in written submissions to U.N. human rights mechanisms and to give the treaty bodies more information on these specific issues to help build stronger and more responsive standards.  Referring to these reports can also strengthen our advocacy.  Accordingly, we provide a brief overview of some of the most relevant Special Procedure reports at the end of this briefing paper. Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Women and Girls with Disabilities: An Overview Stereotypes about women with disabilities—including that they cannot make decisions for themselves, are asexual, will not be good parents, or cannot become pregnant—may lead health care workers and others to discount their needs or subject them to abuse. At the same time, when sexual and reproductive health services and information are not designed with disability-related accessibility in mind, women with disabilities may be effectively denied the opportunity to make decisions about their health and about the timing and spacing of their children. Forms and Manifestations of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Violations against Women and Girls with Disabilities According to the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, these practices are frequently based on false and discriminatory assumptions about the sexuality and ability of women with disabilities to parent or are based on the desire to control their menstrual cycles. Frequently, these forced reproductive health procedures performed on women with disabilities—particularly those deprived of legal capacity whose parents, guardians, or doctors might make the decision on their behalf—are not only allowed to occur in practice but are also specifically permitted by law. Forced or coerced sterilization of women and girls with disabilities causes particular harms, because although in rare cases it may be reversible, female sterilization is considered a permanent form of contraception, meaning that women who undergo sterilization will not be able to have children. Concerning informed consent, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics has found that “[o]nly women themselves can give ethically valid consent to their own sterilisation.  Family members – including husbands, parents, legal guardians, medical practitioners and, for instance, government or other public officers – cannot consent on any woman’s or girl’s behalf.” These FIGO guidelines further note that “[m]edical practitioners must recognize that, under human rights provisions and their own professional codes of conduct, it is unethical and in violation of human rights for them to perform procedures for prevention of future pregnancy on women who have not freely requested such procedures or who have not previously given their free and informed consent.” For instance, sexuality education provided to children inside and outside of school may leave out children with disabilities, as schools or teachers may assume that children with disabilities do not need this information. Information about sexual and reproductive health is also frequently not provided in accessible formats. The information that is provided to women with disabilities about reproductive health care and parenting may undermine their rights, exposing a bias in the community that persons with disabilities are not able to care for their children. Furthermore, equipment and facilities in sexual and reproductive health care settings may also not be physically accessible nor be designed with women with disabilities in mind. All of this means that women with disabilities may have less access to essential sexual and reproductive health services, such as contraception, abortion, and maternal health services, and may also be less likely to be screened for reproductive cancers. However, sexual and reproductive health care providers may fail to screen women with disabilities for violence, including sexual and domestic violence, because of misconception that persons with disabilities are not sexually active. Ensuring Rights Protections for Women and Girls with Disabilities in Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Settings Protections in these settings consist of not only the right to health, but also the rights to equal recognition before the law and to the exercise of legal capacity on an equal basis with others; the rights to decide on the number and spacing of children and to found a family; the rights to physical and mental integrity and to be free from torture or ill-treatment; the right to privacy; the rights to equality, non-discrimination, and to be free from harmful stereotyping; and the right to accessibility, including in access to information and health care services. These rights, interpreted alongside each other, create a right for women and girls with disabilities to the exercise of sexual and reproductive autonomy. Indeed, in 1994, 179 states agreed to these principles by signing on to the Programme of Action for the International Conference on Population and Development, which states that reproductive rights include the right “to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.” As such, they should be given the opportunity to provide informed consent for any medical procedure, on an equal basis with others.  If a reproductive health procedure is performed on a woman or girl without her informed consent—regardless of whether a parent, guardian, health care worker, judge, or other individual provides consent—it should be considered a forced or coerced procedure and subject to sanctions. States should make efforts to provide sexuality education and information on sexuality and reproduction through sign language interpretation, in Braille, in easy-to-understand formats, and through other technologies to ensure that women with disabilities have the information they need to make decisions. They should also ensure that physical spaces where health care services are provided are accessible, that accessible equipment is available to meet the health needs of women with disabilities, and that there is available and accessible transportation to and from those facilities.  Finally, states should ensure that health care workers are trained to work with persons with disabilities and provide services that are based on dignity and that respect the autonomy of persons with disabilities. Questions to Consider The following questions, while not exhaustive, may help advocates identify key issues to raise in a country-specific submission addressing the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls with disabilities: Do these laws address the sexual and reproductive health rights of women with disabilities specifically?  Are there any laws and policies that explicitly address parental rights and/or custody for parents with disabilities?  Do these laws or policies make any provisions for the sexual and reproductive health rights of women with disabilities specifically? Are there policies on ensuring informed consent for these procedures and specific training for health care providers?  Do laws or policies contain procedures for holding accountable those who perform forced or coerced reproductive health procedures on women with disabilities, with provisions for compensation and other forms of redress for victims? Does the state collect data regarding the number of women and girls who are forced to take contraception or undergo abortion or sterilization procedures?  Are there any small/regional studies on sexual and reproductive health for women and girls with disabilities that could shed light on the situation for women and girls with disabilities nationwide? To what extent, if at all, is any information on the sexual and reproductive rights of women and girls and the rights of persons with disabilities available in accessible formats?  Does the state make any express provisions to ensure such accessibility?  How well are facilities which are equipped to provide services for women with disabilities distributed geographically across the country?  Does the state provide any funding for health care services, and if so, does that funding provide for disability-inclusive medical instruments or other accessibility measures? Are health care professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel, given any training on treating women with disabilities and the human rights of women and persons with disabilities? Are women and girls with disabilities offered screenings for breast cancer, HIV and other STIs, and other preventative health care screenings on an equal basis with nondisabled women and girls? Is information on such methods available in accessible formats?  Do women and girls with disabilities have access to a range of contraceptive goods and services on the basis of free and informed consent? Are materials for these sexuality education programs available in accessible formats?  Are these programs available to and inclusive of women and girls with disabilities?  Do these programs provide women and girls with disabilities any information on their sexual and reproductive rights?  Has the state undertaken any awareness-raising campaigns about the rights of persons with disabilities in the context of parenting or sexual and reproductive health and rights, with the aim of overcoming stigma about disability and tackling discrimination? To what extent are prenatal services available and accessible to women with disabilities?  To what extent are measures being implemented to protect women and girls with disabilities from forced medical interventions?  accountABILITY: Using U.N. Human Rights Mechanisms to Advance the Rights of Women and Girls with Disabilities The most effective submissions will include information of the type addressed in the above questions to establish that a problem is of a systemic or generalized nature, as well as a few detailed case studies to illustrate the impact of the problem on individuals. Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ESCR Committee) Through its general comments and concluding observations, the ESCR Committee has demonstrated that states have an obligation to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, goods, and information, including sexuality education.  The ESCR Committee frequently addresses sexual and reproductive rights in the context of Article 12 (right to health).  The Committee has also issued recommendations concerning sexual and reproductive rights in the context of Article 13 (right to education) and Article 7 (right to just and favorable conditions of work), as will be explored in more detail below. General Comments General Comment No. 5: Persons with disabilities (1994) The Committee also finds that sterilization and abortion performed on women with disabilities without their informed consent is a serious violation of the right to special protection for mothers, enshrined in Article 10(2) of the ICESCR. General Comment No. 14: The right to the highest attainable standard of health (2000) The right to health also contains a right to participate in decision-making about health at the local, national, and international levels. The ESCR Committee recognizes that the right to health in the ICESCR contains a specific right to sexual and reproductive health, including family planning services, pre- and post-natal care, emergency obstetric services, access to information, and the means to act on that information. Under the right to health, states must ensure that information, goods, facilities, and services related to health care are available, accessible, acceptable, and of good quality for all persons. Although the right to health is a right of progressive realization, in times of resource constraint, the ESCR Committee finds that states must still prioritize ensuring non-discrimination in the right to health and ensure a minimum package of health care, including many sexual and reproductive health goods and services. General Comment No. 16: The equal right of men and women to enjoyment of all economic, social, and cultural rights (2005) As part of this obligation, states must address how gender roles affect social determinants of health and also remove restrictions on access to reproductive health care General Comment No. 20: Non-discrimination in economic and social rights (2009) It also finds that denial of reasonable accommodation to persons with disabilities—including in access to public health facilities—is a form of discrimination in violation of the ICESCR. General Comment No. 22: The right to sexual and reproductive health (2016) It finds that the right to sexual and reproductive health contains the freedom to make decisions about health and about the body free from violence, coercion, or discrimination. It also includes the right to unhindered access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health information, services, goods, and facilities. The Committee finds that states should tailor sexual and reproductive health to the specific needs of individual groups, including by ensuring that persons with disabilities have equal access not only to the same range and quality of care as others but also to services, information, and goods to address their particular needs, provided through reasonable accommodations in an accessible and dignified manner that does not further their marginalization. In particular, the Committee recommends that states provide persons with disabilities with physically accessible facilities, information in accessible formats, decision-making support, and services needed specifically because of their disability. Concluding Observations Access to Reproductive Health Information and Services It has in particular expressed concern where access to sexual and reproductive health information and services, particularly in rural areas The Committee has further expressed concern where states do not have comprehensive sexual and reproductive health programs or policies in place In at least one instance, the Committee has noted that uterine prolapse may occur when women do not have sufficient access to sexual and reproductive health information and services. It has further recommended that at least one state ensure access to sexual and reproductive health care as a means of reducing uterine prolapse. The Committee has also recommended that at least one state seek the advice and assistance of international organizations to ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights. Discrimination in Health Care Access These communities include adolescents, The Committee has in particular expressed concern to at least one state where religious institutions or cultural beliefs have impeded access to sexual and reproductive health care. It has also called on at least one state to ensure that adequate resources are allocated for this purpose. The Committee has further recommended that at least one state provide psychological support and undertake information campaigns to address prejudices against unwed mothers. Access to Contraceptive Information, Goods and Services It has also expressed concern to at least one state where contraception is not free of charge. The Committee has recommended that states ensure that contraceptive information and services are available, accessible, and affordable for all women, including adolescents It has further recommended that states adequately fund the free distribution of contraceptives and remove user fees for public and private family planning services. The Committee has also frequently recommended that states raise awareness about modern and safe contraceptive methods. Emergency Contraception It has particularly expressed concern to at least one state where emergency contraception is not available to victims of rape. The Committee has recommended that at least one state remove barriers to accessing emergency contraception, In particular, it has recommended that at least one state remove restrictions on the free distribution of emergency contraception, take steps to overcome prejudices about the use of emergency contraception, and raise awareness about women’s right to access emergency contraception. Abortion as a Method of Contraception In particular, the ESCR Committee has noted that in at least one state, using abortion as a method of contraception may put women’s health at risk. It has recommended that at least one state raise awareness about safe contraceptive methods and about the health consequences of using abortion as a method of contraception. Abortion Criminalization of Abortion and Restrictive Abortion Laws The Committee has expressed concern to at least one state where a restrictive abortion law led health providers to deny a woman needed medical care, resulting in her death. It has also expressed concern to at least one state about legislation that only allows abortion in cases of rape when the rape was committed against a person with an intellectual or psychosocial disability. Indeed, the Committee has expressed concern to at least one state where a law permits women to access abortion in cases of a risk to their life, fatal fetal anomaly, and when the pregnancy is a result of a crime committed against them, noting that these grounds may still be too restrictive and lead to clandestine and risky abortions. It has also expressed concern to at least one state where women seeking care for pregnancy complications are reported on suspicion of having had abortions, Furthermore, the Committee has expressed concern when a law imposes stiff criminal penalties on doctors who perform emergency abortions if it is later determined that the abortion was illegal, creating a possible chilling effect on the provision of even legal abortion. It has also recommended that states decriminalize abortion in cases of fetal anomaly, Further, the Committee has recommended that states facilitate access to professional services with a view towards eliminating the practice of unsafe abortion It has also recommended to at least one state that it hold a referendum of abortion. The Committee has then additionally recommended that at least one state remove demeaning references to persons with disabilities in its criminal laws related to abortion. In some of these contexts, however, states already allowed abortion in cases of risk to the pregnant woman’s life Practical and Procedural Barriers to Abortion  It has noted to at least one state that lack of access to legal abortion may force women to resort to illegal and unsafe abortion. In particular, the Committee has expressed concern to states where doctors are increasingly using conscientious objection, thus hindering access to legal abortion, Furthermore, the Committee has expressed concern to at least one state where health providers and public prosecutors direct abusive behavior towards pregnant rape victims, thereby limiting their access to abortion. It has also recommended that states ensure that conscientious objection does not pose an obstacle to accessing legal abortion for women who wish to terminate a pregnancy Further, it has recommend that at least one state ensure and monitor access to legal abortion specifically in cases of rape. Post Abortion Care In particular, it has recommended that at least one state focus on providing quality treatment for complications from abortions carried out in unsafe conditions, rather than on prosecutions of illegal abortions. Access to Information on Abortion It has also expressed concern about misinformation regarding abortion in at least one state, obstructing access to legal abortion for victims of rape. The Committee recommended that the state publicize information about crisis pregnancy options to women through effective channels of communication. The Committee has further determined that mandatory counseling prior to abortion is only acceptable if it is neutral and supports the informed choice of women. Training and Guidance It has also recommended that a state upgrade training in order to ensure the implementation of its law on abortion. Selective Abortion The Committee attributes sex-selective abortion to discrimination against women and to son preferences. The Committee has also recommended that states examine and tackle the root causes of sex-selective abortion, Maternal Health It has also expressed concern to at least one state where there are low rates of births attended by skilled birth attendants, particularly in rural areas. Maternal Mortality It has attributed these high rates in various countries to unsafe abortion. The Committee also has linked maternal mortality to lack of access to prenatal and/or postnatal care, It has also recommended that states take urgent steps to tackle maternal mortality, In particular, it has recommended that at least one state provide access to waiting homes for women and provide accommodations and living allowances for midwives, to ensure access to maternal health services in remote areas. It has also recommended that at least two states provide further assistance and training for midwives. Early Pregnancy In this context, it has expressed concern about high rates of abortion among adolescents, The Committee has further expressed concern about early pregnancy in the context of adolescents’ right to education and health, The Committee has also expressed concern where teenagers resort to abortion because of the stigma attached with being an unwed mother. In particular, it has recommended that states ensure access to sexual and reproductive health information and services without the need for parental consent. It has also recommended that states provide support to pregnant teenage adolescents, including support to enable them to continue their education. Sexuality Education and Awareness-Raising It has recommended that this education be comprehensive, The Committee has further recommended that sexuality education be mandatory in schools, Forced Sterilization and Forced Abortion It has also expressed concern where laws and policies require informed consent for sterilization, but where in practice these laws and policies have not stopped the non-consensual sterilizations of women. The Committee in particular has expressed concern where these forced reproductive health practices are focused primarily on ethnic minority women For instance, the ESCR Committee has expressed concern where the decision to undergo sterilization may be taken by a legal representative, rather than a woman with a disability. It has also recommended that at least one state clearly define requirements for free, prior, and informed consent for sterilization and raise awareness among health care providers about these standards. The Committee has further recommended that at least one state take measures to ensure that abortions are carried out voluntarily and under safe conditions. Finally, the Committee has recommended that a state investigate without delay all cases of forced sterilization and guarantee adequate funding for those investigations, Individual Complaints The ESCR Committee’s individual complaint mechanism has only recently gone into effect, and to date there are no decisions on individual complaints related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Gaps in the Standards For instance, given its General Recommendation No. 14 on the right to health—which sets out that health information, goods, and services must be available, accessible, acceptable, and of good quality—the Committee could more consistently comment on accessibility and attitudinal barriers that women and girls with disabilities face when accessing sexual and reproductive health care.  These barriers include physical, financial, communication, and informational barriers to access, as well as stereotypes held by health care professionals and communities about the sexuality, decision-making capacity, and ability to parent of women and girls with disabilities.  It is important for advocates to raise these points with the Committee, so that it has the opportunity to address issues affecting women with disabilities during state reviews. In particular, it would be helpful for the Committee to reinforce agreed ethical guidelines on what constitutes “informed consent” in the context of the acceptability of health services.  It is also important for the Committee to reinforce what steps states should take to meet their obligation to ensure women and girls with disabilities give their voluntary and informed consent for health-related procedures, to investigate allegations of forced or coerced reproductive health procedures performed on women and girls with disabilities, and to provide redress to victims of these human rights violations.

Mission With One Voice is an international movement that aims to strengthen the arts and homelessness sector through exchanges in practice and policy. Background They suffer chronic social and cultural exclusion and many have experienced trauma, resulting in low self-esteem and mental health issues.  The role of the arts in supporting homeless people through improving wellbeing and social inclusion has had a great impact in some countries, but in others, this approach is poorly understood or not used at all.  There is no formal or informal international community for such work.  Existing projects are isolated and do not share learning; there is little inspiration or guidance for new projects.   These projects have helped to build the capacity and infrastructure of arts and homelessness groups in many countries through exchanges in practice and policy – the work has resulted in an expansion of projects, more local networks and homelessness policy being shared and replicated (particularly Brazil’s Homeless People’s Movement being implemented in Manchester).  This movement will build on the success of the model of exchange to help strengthen the arts and homelessness sector globally.  The movement will be project managed by Streetwise Opera and piloted for 5 years.

SUMMARY Para ello, se promueve la articulación de las organizaciones de la sociedad civil en una estrategia de incidencia conjunta dirigida a que las instituciones del Estado prioricen al sector de NNA en la elaboración anual de presupuestos basados en la evidencia de que esta inversión es muy rentable a largo plazo para el conjunto de la sociedad.  Para ello se identificarán y capacitarán NNA con perfil de líder en técnicas de análisis de la realidad, habilidades de participación ciudadana, comunicación, y finalmente en la elaboración de propuestas concretas de inversión social en NNA.  La inclusión de NNA, y especialmente de ellas  ♀ 2. BACKGROUND Actualmente en Bolivia existe una situación de fractura social y política que compromete el desarrollo democrático, la interacción libre entre organizaciones de la sociedad civil y las instituciones del Estado, y la participación en general de la ciudadanía, con énfasis en los grupos de menos recursos.  Tampoco existen espacios reales de accountability o control, y las audiencias públicas son celebradas exclusivamente con agrupaciones afines políticamente al partido del Gobierno.  Las instituciones del Estado no se muestran abiertas a trabajar con las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, tanto por posicionamientos políticos autoritarios (en el caso del nivel nacional, que no admite lecturas socioeconómicas de la realidad distintas a las suyas) como en el caso de negligencia institucional y burocrática (a nivel departamental y municipal). En el año 2017 se registraron 984 enfrentamientos de grupos ciudadanos con las fuerzas del orden público, 6 de ellos calificados como muy graves o como situación de crisis civil.  En 2016 los conflictos se produjeron de forma continuada durante ocho meses consecutivos.  Durante los 12 años de gobierno del actual presidente, Evo Morales, se han registrado 78 civiles fallecidos producto de enfrentamientos entre grupos sociales y la policía o el ejército. Ambos municipios están gobernados por partidos políticos opositores del Gobierno Nacional.  Por ejemplo, en 2016 grupos afines al Gobierno provocaron la quema de oficinas de la alcaldía de El Alto, en la que murieron 6 funcionarios.   Solo en el primer semestre de 2018 se registraron 180 protestas sociales en La Paz y El Alto. En 2013 el Defensor del Pueblo presento una petición de inconstitucionalidad respecto a ciertos artículos de ley nacional 351 y el Decreto Supremo 1597 referidos a la regulación del funcionamiento de las organizaciones de la sociedad civil.  En 2015 El relator especial de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas, Maina Kiai, emitió un informe en el que afirma que efectivamente esta legislación vulnera y restringe el derecho internacional de libre asociatividad. Los NNA se enfrentan a varios retos que afectan a sus posibilidades de sobrevivir y desarrollarse desde la etapa de ‘primera infancia’.  1 de cada 4 NNA menores de 5 años padece algún tipo de afectación crónica de la salud.  Alrededor de 151.000 adolescentes están fuera de la escuela y 4 de cada 10 no completan la educación secundaria.  Cerca de 1 millón de NNA en Bolivia están en riesgo de perder a sus familias. ♀ Las niñas y las adolescentes de 0 a 17 años enfrentan un especial alto riesgo de vulneración de sus derechos en cinco ámbitos específicos: violencia sexual; trata, tráfico y violencia sexual comercial; embarazo precoz; matrimonio adolescente; explotación y discriminación laboral.  Otros factores de inequidad reconocibles son, por ejemplo, el de los NNA con origen étnico rural, o el de los NNA viviendo con capacidades especiales.  De hecho, en un efecto cíclico, la propia restricción de la participación comienza debido a procedimientos burocráticos que no pueden ser cumplidos al carecer los NNA de documentos de identidad -el registro de nacimiento, en lugar de percibirse como un Derecho que el Estado debe satisfacer, se maneja como una concesión de las instituciones a aquellos ciudadanos/as que hacen frente exitosamente a los tramites de solicitud.  Por ello, la propia carencia de registro de nacimiento (y de cedula de identidad en el caso de los adolescentes y jóvenes), es el primero de muchos impedimentos que los NNA encuentran para acceder a servicios esenciales (como por ejemplo de salud, educación, recreación, y en la etapa juvenil, de empleo) que suponen barreras insuperables para el ejercicio real de sus derechos.  La mayoría de la legislación y políticas vigentes no son aplicadas debido a que anualmente los tomadores de decisiones son impermeables a las recomendaciones de las diferentes organizaciones de la sociedad civil, y terminan sub-presupuestando los planes de acción.  El escenario de distribución presupuestaria anual de las instituciones del Estado es clave para hacer una verdadera incidencia en favor de los derechos humanos y ciudadanos de los NNAJ en riesgo.  La participación de la sociedad civil en la formulación de presupuestos públicos se limita al nivel municipal.  Sin embargo, las organizaciones sociales que participan de estos procesos no incluyen a NNAJ en los procesos.  En el nivel departamental y nacional, la participación de la sociedad y mucho más de los NNAJ, es nula.  Por ejemplo, en relación a la construcción de una agenda conjunta, la generación de sinergias, la promoción del retorno de la inversión social en NNA, o la inclusión de NNA en procesos estratégicos de planificación, monitoreo y accountability. Así mismo, las instituciones del Estado y las organizaciones de la sociedad civil necesitan incluir a representantes de los Sujetos de Derechos (esto es, los NNA en riesgo) en los procesos de democratización presupuestaria porque es un aspecto indispensable para la viabilidad de los planes de acción y reconocimiento de la condición ciudadana de los NNA, y en especial de ellas  ♀ Es imprescindible que la ciudadanía pueda acceder a espacios reales de accountability para que exista transparencia, como clave para la cohesión social y la credibilidad entre stakeholders. Para poder tener una interlocución con las instituciones del Estado en defensa de sus necesidades e intereses reales los NNA en riesgo requieren tambien fortalecer su discurso social-político, y en especial ellas  ♀ Trabajar con NNA en riesgo conlleva además acordarse de colectivos especialmente vulnerables a la exclusión en los procesos democráticos, como los NNA de origen rural que viven en la ciudad o los NNA que viven con VIH-SIDA.  El Proyecto planteado, que se desarrollara en La Paz y El Altto entre 2019 y 2021, aborda de manera directa los ‘drivers’ o factores criticos de mayor motricidad con base en una Teoria del Cambio construida participativamente por Toybox, la organizacion implementadora Alalay, y los stakeholders publicos y privados del sector, en Octubre de 2018.  Estos factores precisamente persiguen estimular la percepcion que existe por parte de las instituciones del Estado, y en especial por parte de las del Gobierno Nacional, al respecto de la integracion de las organizaciones de la Sociedad civil y de los NNA Sujetos de Derechos en procesos participativos y de co-construccion democratica de los presupuestos anuales y de las acciones de rendicion de cuentas sociales.  Tal y como se ha mencionado, lograr esto implica trabajar tambien con las organizaciones civiles del sector (que gracias al Proyecto aumentarian su capacidad de formar sinergias y vender un discurso atractivo para el Estado respecto al retorno de la inversion social en NNA) y con los propios NNA, que necesitan desarrollar sus habilidades para madurar un discurso propio como grupo y poder plantear propuestas alternativas consistentes en las instancias participativas que empujen a las instituciones del Estado a escucharles.  3. SUMMARY Para ello, se han dispuesto cuatro Outcomes estrategicos:  Outcome 1: La Red de Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil que trabaja con NNAJ en situación de calle, genera sinergias y se articula en funcion de una Agenda Común de incidencia. Outcome 2: Los tomadores de decisiones de las instituciones del Estado son conscientes del valor social de la inversion en el sector de NNAJ en situacion de vulnerabilidad en el marco de los presupuestos anuales. Outcome 3: Los NNA en situacion de alta vulnerabilidad y las Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil estan empoderados de un discurso propio sobre el valor social de la inversion en el sector de NNAJ en situacion de vulnerabilidad y la rendicion de cuentas sociales. Outcome 4	"NNAJ en situacion de vulnerabilidad participan activamente en comites ciudadanos de accion politica y en procesos estrategicos de las OSC." 	 4. PROJECT ACTIVITIES 1. Verificación de los valores de línea de base del proyecto.  2. Coordinación y puesta en marcha de un plan de incidencia conjunto por parte de las OSC y las instituciones del Estado.   3. Diseño conjunto de una Teoria del Cambio sectorial 4. Mapeo de contactos y desarrollo de relaciones públicas con OSC e Instituciones del Estado.  5. Presentaciones de propuestas alternativas de distribución presupuestaria para el ejercicio 2021 ante instituciones del Estado  6. Elaboración de herramientas amigables de difusión y marketing visual sobre el retorno de la inversión en NNAJ vulnerables. 7. Capacitación a Directores de OSC y funcionarios de instituciones del Estado en análisis de los presupuestos del Estado con enfoque de retorno de inversión y en gestión de la auditoria social. 8. Capacitación a NNAJ representantes en presupuestos del Estado, técnicas de comunicación con enfoque de retorno de inversión y auditoria social. 9. Diseño participativo y presentación de una propuesta alternativa de presupuestos de instituciones del Estado junto a OSC y NNAJ, y sistematización del aprendizaje. 10. Apoyo a OSC de la Red para que incluyan a NNAJ en espacios amigables de planificación estratégica y aboguen ante el Estado por su inclusión en las estructuras ciudadanas previstas en la legislación. 11. Capacitación y apoyo a NNAJ representantes para su participación activa en comités y consejos ciudadanos, y para la sistematización del aprendizaje. 12. Monitoreo y evaluación participativa de la acción del proyecto incluyendo la retroalimentación progresiva de los participantes beneficiarios y la sistematización de aprendizajes.	 5. EVALUATION PLAN Este componente representa uno de los principales valores agregados de la participacion de Toybox para llevar a cabo el Proyecto propuesto, pues complementa las fortalezas de la organizacion implementadora Alalay con otras en el area MEAL que Toybox ha consolidado a lo largo de los ultimos anos en Bolivia y otros paises.   El Proyecto esta formulado con enfoque de Teoria del Cambio, que garantiza la orientacion de todos los componentes a la vision de resultados e impacto.  Se partira de una linea de base que ha sido parcialmente completada antes del inicio del Proyecto y sera concluida en el primer trimestre de implementacion con valores actualizados.  Estos informes tambien incorporaran informacion actualizada relativa a la contabilizacion de beneficiarios, a la programacion de actividades, al registro de potenciales incidents de salvaguardia, y a la evolucion de Assumptions y riesgos en paralelo a la ejecucion del proyecto.  Toybox promueve la incorporacion de ajustes a la planificacion bajo el ‘adaptive programming’ approach basados en aprendizajes sistematizados durante el periodo de implementacion.  Esto permitira cruzar el progreso reportado a traves de informes trimestrales con una big picture que contraste los valores de la linea de base con los del impacto.  Pero tambien permitira verificar el feedback recogido periodicamente por el equipo de campo con un feedback mas estructurado y orientado al mejoramiento de la accion en su conjunto.  Se realizara un informe anual de auditoria financiera.  7. ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND N/A 8. BENEFICIARY En cuanto a adultos, contabilizaremos a todos aquellos miembros de instituciones publicas y OSC que participen activamente en reuniones (excluyendo a aquellos que solo aparezcan en alguna reunion o no se muestren participativos). 			 									 En cuanto a beneficiarios indirectos, aqui pondriamos una estimacion de la poblacion total de NNAJ con la que trabajan los miembros de las redes, pues las labores de incidencia estarian beneficiando, indirectamente a todos ellos/as.

The INEE Strategic Framework 2018-2023 presents the network’s vision for how to reach its overarching goal: To ensure the right to a quality, safe, and relevant education for all who live in emergency and crisis contexts through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. INEE believes this goal can be achieved by focusing on the following four strategic priorities: Provide thought leadership and global advocacy Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice Strengthen and diversify INEE membership These priorities were identified through a review of the INEE Strategic Plan 2015-2017 and in-depth consultation with INEE members in late 2017 to determine INEE’s strengths and core added value in the EiE field. INEE’s support for its members is bidirectional: it enables its members to engage, collaborate, and contribute to the network’s achievement of the Strategic Framework, while simultaneously providing support for members in their daily work and  their efforts to advance the field of EiE in line with INEE's core functions. ” The principles of prevention, preparedness and response, and established international guidelines such as the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) Minimum Standards, should guide planning and response. — Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4, p. 34 ” Further details on INEE’s strategic priorities, along with its history, mission, guiding principles, values, and functions, are described in this document. Introduction The Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) is an open, global network of individuals and representatives from NGOs, UN agencies, donor agencies, governments (including Ministries of Education), academic institutions, schools, and affected populations who are working together to ensure that all individuals have the right to a quality, relevant, safe, and equitable education in situations of emergency and post-crisis recovery. 11  12 13  Mission INEE is an open, global network of members working together within a humanitarian and development framework to ensure that all individuals have the right to a quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education. Vision INEE envisions a world in which: All people affected by crisis and instability have access to quality, safe, and relevant educational opportunities; Education services are integrated into all emergency interventions as an essential life-saving and life-sustaining component of humanitarian response and development assistance, governments and donors provide sustainable funding for education services and develop evidence-based, holistic policies to ensure crisis prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery; and Consistent with the INEE Minimum Standards, all education programs preparing for and responding to emergencies are evidence-informed and accountable for quality and results. © Caroline Trutmann, Save the Children, Angola, 2008 Guiding Principles Aligned with Humanitarian Principles, the following represent INEE's guiding principles: 14 Education is a basic human right of all people, including those affected by crisis and instability. Education protects during crises and lays a sustainable foundation for recovery, peace, and development. Education should be included in all humanitarian responses. Education policy and services must be actively sustained and coordinated across the humanitarian-development continuum before, during, and in the recovery phase of crises. Education, like other humanitarian and development endeavors, must adhere to clear standards of quality, and be accountable for results.  Crises that destabilize education can be approached not only as urgent situations of immediate need but also as opportunities for positive change. Positive and lasting impact depends on collaborative action by a wide variety of stakeholders. Respecting diversity recognizes differences between people and acknowledges that these differences are a valued asset. Rich discussion and decision-making relies on proactively enabling marginalized voices to be heard. Acknowledging historical and real power differences is essential to maintaining a strong commitment to equity, inclusion, and diversity.

ANNEX 2 : INEE Theory of Change To ensure the right to a quality, safe, and relevant education for all who live in emergency and crisis contexts through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. INEE believes this goal can be achieved by focusing on the following four strategic priorities: Provide thought leadership and global advocacy. Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all. Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice. Strengthen and diversify INEE membership. by employing the “soft power” of convening and facilitating, not directing and competing, to draw agencies together, sustain commitment, and strengthen collaboration. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES Provide thought leadership and global advocacy Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice Strengthen and diversify INEE membership VISION All people affected by crisis and instability have access to quality, safe, and relevant education opportunities OUTCOMES Increased adoption of the Minimum Standards in the policy documents of key education actors and donors Improved access to professional development for EiE practitioners and teachers in crisis contexts improved accessibility, production, and use of data and evidence in EiE Increased participation of members from diverse contexts in INEE network spaces and learning forums * For more detail, see Results Framework MEMBERSHIP 15,000 members in 130 partner  organizations in 190 countries PROBLEM 75 million children and youth in crisis contexts are not accessing quality, safe, relevant, and inclusive education ANNEX 3: INEE Network Spaces and Initiatives INEE members are part of a global community of practice that provides opportunities for engagement at many levels. INEE Network Infrastructure Description Steering Group Secretariat INEE Network Spaces  (Member Engagement) Description Education Policy Working Group (EPWG) Standards & Practice Working Group Advocacy Working Group Collaboratives Academic Space The Journal on Education in Emergencies (JEiE) publishes groundbreaking and outstanding scholarly and practitioner work on education in emergencies (EiE), defined broadly as quality learning opportunities for all ages in situations of crisis, including early childhood development, primary, secondary, non-formal, technical, vocational, higher and adult education. Task Teams Language Communities Reference Groups INEE Reference Groups are convened for specific topics needing expert input or guidance. Global Meet-ups INEE Meet-Up events are open and informal gatherings in all corners of the globe where INEE members and others can network, share experiences, and discuss relevant topics.

Each individual then strengthens an intervention for 500 individuals affected by crisis. 15,000 INEE members x 3 colleagues x 500 beneficiaries Additionally, one must consider the network’s 130 partner organizations who have incorporated INEE tools into their interventions targeted at the estimated 65 million children who are most directly affected by emergencies. An INEE member shares knowledge with 3 colleagues.   Those colleagues improve the quality of their interventions. 500 people in crisis contexts benefit from improved quality interventions. ANNEX 5: INEE Network Functions Community-Building Convening INEE brings stakeholders together to foster dialogue, advance research to build the evidence base, and support the establishment of partnerships to work toward shared solutions. Knowledge Management INEE gathers, filters, organizes, synthesizes, and disseminates relevant information to strengthen individual and institutional capacities. Amplifying and Advocating INEE enables the voices of its members to influence change in policy and practice, and promotes new, little-known, or poorly understood ideas. Facilitationg and Learning The INEE network promotes collective action to help members develop their capacities and carry out their activities more efficiently and effectively. Providing Tools and Resources The network mobilizes and disseminates resources, materials, and opportunities that support members' work and respond to their demands.

Common situations of crisis in which education in emergencies is essential include conflicts, protracted crises, situations of violence, forced displacement, disasters, and public health emergencies. Education in emergencies is a wider concept than 'emergency education response' which is an essential part of it. Despite the many gains made in education over the past two decades, both globally and in locations affected by crises, humanitarian assistance and funding for education in emergencies 1  2  3  It is within this environment that the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) recognizes the need to adopt a set of collective strategic priorities to ensure that all people who are affected by emergencies and protracted crises receive an equitable, quality, safe, and relevant education. Through the network’s four strategic priorities, which All activities INEE undertakes pay attention to gender equality, inclusivity, and equity and ensure that INEE’s tools and resources enable all girls, boys, and young women and men All INEE initiatives are undertaken through consultative processes, ensuring that the network continues to serve its members through its primary functions:  community-building, convening, knowledge management, amplifying and advocating, facilitating and learning, and providing our greater membership with quality tools and resources © Juan Arredondo/IRC, Colombia INEE continues to play a leading role in engaging humanitarian and development actors, researchers and practitioners, donors and policymakers, education authorities, 4  adversity INEE today is a key education agent in multiple dialogues and planning forums on fragility, conflict, violence, crises, and emergencies.  The fact that INEE has grown exponentially over the past 20 years in terms of the delivery of products, membership, development of partnerships, and leadership in the field of education in emergencies is a testament to the network’s continued relevance, and the commitment of its many members. Your engagement with INEE is our true success, and we look forward to working with you to ensure that all people affected by crisis and instability have access to quality, relevant, and safe educational opportunities. Sincerely, on behalf of the INEE Steering Group, Jennifer Sklar International Rescue Committee INEE Steering Group Co-Chair Annelies Ollieuz Norwegian Refugee Council INEE Steering Group Co-Chair Executive Summary The increase in the number and type of global crises, and the world’s growing attention to these, means that the support INEE provides as a network and community of practice for education in emergencies (EiE) is invaluable to all who work in these contexts. The world is witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record.” 5  These reports indicate that, in 2018, 135.1 million people needed assistance, compared to 77.9 million people in 2015. 6  These shocking statistics do not begin to touch on the human stories behind the numbers. girls, boys, and young people Forcible displacement strains psychological and emotional well-being, adversely affecting education achievements. 7 The Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG4 on education, commit countries to “leave no one behind” and to ensure that even the poorest and most marginalized communities, including refugees and internally displaced persons, have an opportunity to learn.  The importance of supporting host authorities and communities to expand access to education for refugee children and youth features prominently in the Global Compact on Refugees, which reaffirms international commitment to expand and enhance the quality and inclusiveness of national education systems to facilitate access by refugee and host community children and youth to primary, secondary, and tertiary education. 8 9  10  This included a growing emphasis on localization, harmonization with the development community, and greater coordination within the humanitarian sector.  This increased the recognition of EiE and acknowledged that education is not only a fundamental right but a means of protection, prevention, and prosperity for communities and countries in danger of, currently experiencing, or emerging from, humanitarian and other protracted crises. As the leading global network in the field, INEE is well positioned to advance EiE at all levels.  INEE’s unique network approach ensures that all those working to deliver quality, relevant, safe and equitable education in times of crisis have the tools, As a global community of practice, INEE seeks to advance the rapidly evolving EiE field and meet the educational rights, needs, and aspirations of people affected by disasters, conflicts, protracted crises, and other situations of adversity. The INEE Strategic Framework 2018-2023 presents the network’s vision for how to reach its overarching goal: To ensure the right to a quality, safe, and relevant education for all who live in emergency and crisis contexts through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. INEE believes this goal can be achieved by focusing on the following four strategic priorities: Provide thought leadership and global advocacy Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice Strengthen and diversify INEE membership These priorities were identified through a review of the INEE Strategic Plan 2015-2017 and in-depth consultation with INEE members in late 2017 to determine INEE’s strengths and core added value in the EiE field. INEE’s support for its members is bidirectional: it enables its members to engage, collaborate, and contribute to the network’s achievement of the Strategic Framework, while simultaneously providing support for members in their daily work and  their efforts to advance the field of EiE in line with INEE's core functions. INEE is committed to maintaining a collaborative, facilitative, network-based approach in efforts to meet these priorities. ” The principles of prevention, preparedness and response, and established international guidelines such as the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) Minimum Standards, should guide planning and response. — Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4, p. 34 ” Further details on INEE’s strategic priorities, along with its history, mission, guiding principles, values, and functions, are described in this document. Introduction The Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) is an open, global network of individuals and representatives from NGOs, UN agencies, donor agencies, governments (including Ministries of Education), academic institutions, schools, and affected populations who are working together to ensure that all individuals have the right to a quality, relevant, safe, and equitable education in situations of emergency and post-crisis recovery. As a result, UNESCO, UNICEF, and UNHCR committed to advance Strategy Five of the Dakar Framework which focused on “...the needs of education systems affected by conflict, natural calamities and instability....” 11  12 Guided by a Steering Group and bylaws, 13  All of INEE’s work can be classified according to one or more of these functions. Mission INEE is an open, global network of members working together within a humanitarian and development framework to ensure that all individuals have the right to a quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education. Vision INEE envisions a world in which: All people affected by crisis and instability have access to quality, safe, and relevant educational opportunities; Education services are integrated into all emergency interventions as an essential life-saving and life-sustaining component of humanitarian response and development assistance, governments and donors provide sustainable funding for education services and develop evidence-based, holistic policies to ensure crisis prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery; and Consistent with the INEE Minimum Standards, all education programs preparing for and responding to emergencies are evidence-informed and accountable for quality and results. © Caroline Trutmann, Save the Children, Angola, 2008 Guiding Principles Aligned with Humanitarian Principles, the following represent INEE's guiding principles: 14 Education is a basic human right of all people, including those affected by crisis and instability. Education protects during crises and lays a sustainable foundation for recovery, peace, and development. Education should be included in all humanitarian responses. Education policy and services must be actively sustained and coordinated across the humanitarian-development continuum before, during, and in the recovery phase of crises. Education, like other humanitarian and development endeavors, must adhere to clear standards of quality, and be accountable for results.  Crises that destabilize education can be approached not only as urgent situations of immediate need but also as opportunities for positive change. Positive and lasting impact depends on collaborative action by a wide variety of stakeholders. Respecting diversity recognizes differences between people and acknowledges that these differences are a valued asset. Rich discussion and decision-making relies on proactively enabling marginalized voices to be heard. Acknowledging historical and real power differences is essential to maintaining a strong commitment to equity, inclusion, and diversity. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES & THEMATIC FOCUS AREAS 10	INEE Strategic Framework 2018-2023 © Stacy Hughes, Amman, Jordan, 2004 INEE’s Strategy at a Glance Overall Goal To enable quality, safe, and relevant education for all in emergencies and crisis contexts through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. Strategic Priorities Provide thought leadership and global advocacy Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice Strengthen and diversify INEE membership Thematic Focus Areas Humanitarian-development coherence Defining and measuring quality learning Mental health and well-being Youth and skills Community-Building  •  Convening  •  Knowledge Management  • Amplifying and Advocating  •  Facilitating and Learning  •  Providing Tools and Resources INEE Strategic Framework 2018-2023 It serves the network, its members, and stakeholders by: Providing the basis for the network’s work plans and activities, as well as a framework for monitoring progress and evaluating the impact of INEE’s actions; Providing the INEE Steering Group, INEE Secretariat, and INEE’s network spaces (working groups, task teams, language communities, etc.) with clear direction on relevant issues critical to the continuity of education in crises and crisis-prone contexts; Providing guidance to INEE management to support prioritization and decision-making; and Conveying INEE’s approach and methods to its members, supporters, policy-makers, and donors, and providing guidelines for measuring the impact and efficacy of the resources employed. The INEE Strategic Framework has been designed to enable the network to remain proactive, adaptable, and responsive to unforeseen events and emerging issues. The review also informed the development The significant achievements and remaining challenges identified in the review cover the six domains of INEE’s functions and are addressed in the INEE Annual Report 2017. 15  © UNICEF, Afghanistan INEE’s Strategic Priorities As a global community of practice, INEE counts on its members to engage, support, collaborate, and contribute to achieving the overarching goal set forth in this Strategic Framework: To ensure the right to a quality, safe, relevant education for all who live in emergency and crisis contexts through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. INEE’s four strategic priorities identify areas in which the network can play a unique role and contribute most effectively to serving those affected by emergencies and The four strategic priorities are as follows: Provide thought leadership and global advocacy. Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all. Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice. Strengthen and diversify INEE membership. The following pages provide further details on each strategic priority and give illustrative examples of INEE’s strategic actions and expected outcomes tied to each priority. © Jenny Matthews, CARE, Chad 2007 STRATEGIC PRIORITY 1: Provide Thought Leadership and Global Advocacy child or young person The need for education before, during, and after humanitarian conflicts and other crises has never been greater.  Societies and economies emerging from crises need educated populations to lead the next generation.  INEE has consistently advocated this message since its beginnings in 2000.  However, it is only recently that the spotlight has been put on EiE, particularly in the lead-up to the 2015 World Humanitarian Summit and the founding of the Education Cannot Wait Fund (ECW).  INEE played a significant role in the development of ECW and is an  ex officio  Despite this increased recognition of the need for EiE, many issues remain in terms of its provision that will require stronger leadership and advocacy to overcome. It will leverage the voices and contributions of its members and strategic partners and use its convening power to reach policy-makers and decision-makers within and beyond the education sector.  Through collaborative, evidence-based inter-agency initiatives and dialogue, INEE will help to shape the public debate on key issues related to the provision of education in humanitarian and development contexts.  By developing and strengthening strategic partnerships, it will inform and contribute to the policy dialogue and thought leadership on EiE. More sustained multi-year targeted funding for EiE ACTIONS	OUTCOMES Develop policy forum and briefs.  INEE will host policy forums and develop briefs to further understand and define the role of EiE in strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus. Strengthened awareness and understanding of the humanitarian-development nexus Strengthen and/or develop strategic partnerships.  Strategic partnerships will be formed to help shape policy dialogue and thought leadership, including a targeted campaign to integrate and promote the use of the Minimum Standards. Increased adoption of the INEE Minimum Standards in the policy documents of key education actors and donors Advocate for uptake and policy change related to INEE's stated priorities.  INEE network spaces and members at all levels will leverage a growing evidence base to advocate effectively and influence policy changes related to the right to a quality, safe, and relevant education in all contexts. Increased measurement of equitable access and quality learning outcomes in crisis contexts Develop and disseminate research-based advocacy messages, tools and resources.  Through updated communication strategies and website development, INEE will disseminate advocacy messages to a wide and diverse audience. Key evidence-based advocacy messages, tools, and resources are developed and disseminated STRATEGIC PRIORITY 2: Strengthen Capacity to Deliver Quality, Safe, Relevant, and Equitable Education for All However, the review of the INEE Strategic Plan 2015-2017 revealed a great need for capacity development for both education professionals in the EiE EiE Many respondents indicated a need for increased professionalization and training to provide field-based humanitarian and development practitioners with the technical skills to deliver quality EiE. Efforts will be taken to ensure the sustainability of capacity-development tools and resources by facilitating multilingual global sharing and promotion of best practices.  INEE will continue to support members' application, adaptation, contextualization, and  institutionalization This process will be led increasingly INEE will work increasingly with national and local partners to deliver capacity-development strategies that are relevant and appropriate to their contexts. ACTIONS	OUTCOMES Harmonized professional development for EiE practitioners Develop and roll out a capacity-building strategy.  INEE will work increasingly with national and local partners to deliver relevant face-to-face and online technical training for EiE.  	 Improved access to professional development tools and stronger capacities Create and disseminate interactive INEE tools.  This will build on  the update  	 Resources and guidelines developed and disseminated Create and disseminate resources and guidelines for EiE decision makers.  For example, INEE will conduct case studies on what works in alternative education programs with consideration of context, age group, gender, migration status, disability, etc.  	 STRATEGIC PRIORITY 3: Provide, Curate, and Organize Knowledge to Inform Policy and Practice During the review of the INEE Strategic Plan 2015-2017, it became evident that INEE is perceived as the hub where knowlegde and evidence on EiE should be collected, curated, and amplified for policy-makers, practitioners, and academics. In light of this need, INEE plans to develop a sector-wide INEE learning agenda, bringing together key partners to ensure that the sector takes a targeted approach to building the EiE evidence-base. INEE is an appropriate space for the development of a systematic approach to measuring results, especially considering the  network's broader priority to make quality and practical tools to measure impact available. Through consultative approaches to collecting and curating EiE tools, INEE ensures that ongoing research is informed by and useful for practitioners and that quality resources are developed based on robust  evidence INEE will continue to support the work of the  Journal on Education in Emergencies  ACTIONS	OUTCOMES Updated INEE learning agenda Increase strategic knowledge-sharing of research, best practices, and resources.  INEE will do this by regularly convening and facilitating events where members can debate, discuss, and prioritize research needs, initiatives, methodologies, findings, etc., with the overall goal of developing an EiE INEE learning agenda.  	 Develop an INEE monitoring and evaluation framework and toolkit.  Based on a consultative process, INEE will develop, validate, and roll out a comprehensive EiE monitoring and evaluation framework and toolkit. Strengthened monitoring and evaluation Improve the INEE web platform.  INEE will redesign the INEE website to better curate and disseminate knowledge and promote resources relevant to policy and practice. New website developed, including redesign of the EiE Toolkit and enhancement of the INEE resource database Strengthen the EiE evidence base.  INEE will continue to curate and share EiE evidence on its various knowledge platforms, including the INEE Resource Database and EiE Toolkit. Improved accessibility, production, and use of data and evidence in EiE  	 STRATEGIC PRIORITY 4: Strengthen and Diversify INEE Membership During the review of the INEE Strategic Plan 2015-2017, the value of this wide membership was perceived as one of INEE's greatest achievements.  It was cited together with INEE's unique and neutral convening power as the most important component of INEE's added value as a network.  However, despite INEE's global outreach, the voices of the wider membership do not always get translated or heard in the global policy debates.  These voices need to be amplified INEE therefore commits to leveraging its membership for greater advocacy and outreach purposes. INEE commits to developing stronger communications systems and innovative approaches in order to engage a more diverse membership.  INEE therefore will focus on providing better opportunities for engagement with members, institutions, and academia in order to strengthen inputs from under-represented groups.  It will encourage meaningful virtual and in-person engagement and improve outreach to its diverse membership and multilingual communities. Secure resources to increase the participation of under-represented groups at network spaces and learning forums.  INEE will increase the number of engaged members and strategic partners, including non-traditional partners and those from under-represented contexts. Increased participation of members from diverse contexts in INEE network spaces and learning forums ACTIONS	OUTCOMES Develop and roll out a membership outreach strategy.  INEE will develop an outreach strategy to expand the role of and opportunities for participation of members of language communities. Ensure timely information-sharing in all INEE working languages.  INEE will continue to maintain, grow, and strengthen the INEE website, INEE toolkit, bi-weekly bulletins, and social media, as well as accessibility in INEE's core languages (Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish). All INEE knowledge products are available in key languages Hold events in locations that enable people from under-represented contexts to participate.  INEE will host more learning or policy forums and convene meetings in countries and locations that enable the participation of members from under-represented contexts. Increased percentage of INEE events held in locations that enable equitable representation and participation of the wider INEE membership  	 Thematic Focus Areas This more targeted and strategic approach will enable the network to engage and contribute to core aspects of EiE in a focused way through the various network spaces.  The following four themes are reflective of but not limited to the workplans of INEE’s three Working Groups, Collaboratives, Task Teams and Reference Groups: Humanitarian-development coherence Defining and measuring quality learning Mental health and well-being Youth and skills Humanitarian-Development Coherence 16 It is also the case that education for those receiving humanitarian assistance and in situations of protracted crisis is insufficiently funded.  Not providing education in humanitarian settings is a long-term problem, especially in light of the protracted nature of displacement.  The average length of displacement for refugees is 10.3 years, and for those in protracted situations (displacement 17  Given the protracted nature of displacement, it is important  that EiE programs 18  Ministries This implies the need to strengthen coordination between humanitarian and development actors engaged not only in education but in other sectors that support girls and boys and  young people Linked to INEE Strategic Priority 1, for example, INEE is engaged in a strategic partnership with UNHCR and the Global Education Cluster with the support of the Education Cannot Wait Fund to understand how coordination of response can be further strengthened. Linked to INEE Strategic Priority 3, INEE will curate and amplify evidence developed by its membership and EiE partners related to humanitarian-development coherence. Defining and Measuring Quality Learning Mental Health and Well-Being 19  20  The World Bank’s Learning to Realize Education’s Promise report argues that, if students fail to learn, education cannot deliver on Even after several years in school, millions of children cannot read, write, or do basic math. 21  The SDG4 education targets aim to hold The targets refer to “quality early childhood development, care, and pre-primary education” and “quality primary and secondary education” that help students achieve “relevant and effective learning outcomes.” 22  23 © Christopher Scott/IRC, Sudan Children and youth in crisis-affected communities often struggle with a range of social, emotional, and mental health barriers which prevent them from attending or remaining in school.  As such, it is important to take into consideration their specific mental health needs when designing teaching programs. 24  The impact emergencies have on families’ and communities’ ability to function in turn impacts the development of children and young people.  INEE’s ”Background Paper on Psychosocial Support and Social and Emotional Learning for Children and Youth in Emergency Settings” also highlights the fact that “receiving an education in a supportive environment builds children’s intellectual and emotional competencies, provides social support through interactions with peers and educators, and strengthens children’s sense of control and self-worth... 25 Linked to INEE Strategic Priority 1, INEE will support joint planning, programming, and advocacy among education and protection actors for conflict risk reduction and conflict-sensitive education measures in order to ensure continued access to safe education during conflicts. This will provide the basis for the development of common indicators, measures, and program tools.  The Collaborative also will explore dimensions of teacher psychosocial support and SEL and links to classroom climate and equitable student outcomes.  The group will develop a hands-on pocket guide for EiE practitioners on how to deliver psychosocial support and SEL for children and caretakers effectively and speedily in school and community settings. Youth and Skills 26  young people They are more likely than young children to be recruited into fighting forces; to be sexually abused and exploited; to be forced to earn a livelihood and engage in exploitive labor; to head a household; to miss out on education; to contract sexually transmitted infections such as HIV; and to lack reproductive health care. 27  For young people who are displaced, the nature of protracted refugee situations (on average 17 years) means that entire generations may be missing out These factors can severely constrain the social development and livelihood opportunities of young people living in crisis situations. 28  29 This work will be advanced through a collaboration with organizations represented in INEE’s Working Groups and continued coordination of the INEE Youth and Adolescents Task Team. INEE will offer policy-makers and programmers a set of practical recommendations for addressing these constraints, including the identification of best practices and programs that have the potential to inspire others and/or be adapted and replicated in similar contexts. © Mats Lignell, Save the Children, Kabul, Afghanistan Conclusion From this basis, INEE will take steps to establish systems of member engagement, conduct regular strategic and operational reviews, and apply the learning outlined here in order to continually improve.  Implementing the Strategic Framework will depend greatly on the engagement of members, the development of effective strategic partnerships, the effective functioning of the network spaces (including Working Groups, Collaboratives, Task Teams, Language Communities, Reference Groups), adequate funding, and the continued support of hosting and supporting agencies. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the duration of the Strategic Framework include several features: It will specify a work plan for all sections and structures of the network, and include detailed indicators in addition to the projected results listed beneath each Strategic Priority. The review will ensure that the Strategic Framework remains relevant, and it will be adjusted according to findings of the annual reviews. As highlighted throughout the Strategic Framework, INEE supports its members collectively and individually through its core functions of: community-building, convening, knowledge management, amplifying and advocating, facilitating and learning, and providing.  Throughout the six years of this plan, these network functions will guide the identification and prioritization of network activities. © Andrea Naletto, INEE, Colombia We invite all interested individuals and organizations who implement, support, advocate for and study education in disasters, conflicts, protracted crises, For more information, please visit the INEE website. www.ineesite.org ANNEXES 22	INEE Strategic Framework 2018-2023 © Peter Biro, IRC, Atmeh, Syria ANNEX 1: INEE Strategy Results Framework Strategic Priority Outcome  (specific result/ objective intended to achieve) Activity  (individual tasks) Output  (completed product of specific activities) Indicator Baseline (2018) Target (2020)* Network Space Inputs 1.

ANNEX 2 : INEE Theory of Change The INEE Strategic Framework sets overarching priorities and ambitions for the network, with the aim of achieving the network’s overall goal: To ensure the right to a quality, safe, and relevant education for all who live in emergency and crisis contexts through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. INEE believes this goal can be achieved by focusing on the following four strategic priorities: Provide thought leadership and global advocacy. Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all. Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice. Strengthen and diversify INEE membership. INEE plays a facilitative rather than an operational role.  It complements other more formal inter-agency mechanisms by employing the “soft power” of convening and facilitating, not directing and competing, to draw agencies together, sustain commitment, and strengthen collaboration. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES Provide thought leadership and global advocacy Strengthen capacity to deliver quality, safe, relevant, and equitable education for all Provide, curate, and organize knowledge to inform policy and practice Strengthen and diversify INEE membership VISION All people affected by crisis and instability have access to quality, safe, and relevant education opportunities OUTCOMES Increased adoption of the Minimum Standards in the policy documents of key education actors and donors Improved access to professional development for EiE practitioners and teachers in crisis contexts improved accessibility, production, and use of data and evidence in EiE Increased participation of members from diverse contexts in INEE network spaces and learning forums * For more detail, see Results Framework MEMBERSHIP 15,000 members in 130 partner  organizations in 190 countries PROBLEM 75 million children and youth in crisis contexts are not accessing quality, safe, relevant, and inclusive education ANNEX 3: INEE Network Spaces and Initiatives INEE members are part of a global community of practice that provides opportunities for engagement at many levels. INEE Network Infrastructure Description Steering Group The INEE Steering Group is composed of organizational members, represented by senior professionals in the field of education in emergencies.  Steering Group members are all equal in status, and no one Steering Group member Steering Group organizations commit to support INEE with monetary and in-kind contributions, including travel to two annual Steering Group meetings and hosting of meetings.  In addition to attending two Steering Group meetings per year, representatives give substantial time reviewing and providing strategic input on INEE activities.  For more details about the INEE Steering Group, please refer to the INEE By-Laws document. Secretariat INEE Secretariat staff are hosted by INEE Steering Group member agencies, which not only helps to ensure promotion and institutionalization of education in emergencies within those agencies but is also cost-efficient. INEE Network Spaces  (Member Engagement) Description Education Policy Working Group (EPWG) Through EPWG, INEE fosters collaboration between 27 working group member organizations and coordinates initiatives to build evidence and knowledge in order to inform policies, planning, and practices of education ministries, donors, field practitioners, and implementing agencies in crisis-affected contexts Standards & Practice Working Group The current group (2018-2020) builds on the background of the WG’s achievements since 2004, including around knowledge management, capacity development, and contextualization and application of the INEE Minimum Standards.  The SPWG leads INEE’s efforts to mobilize knowledge and develop innovative strategies to professionalize and build capacities within the field of EiE. Advocacy Working Group Originally known as the Education Cannot Wait Advocacy Working Group, an early focus was on advocating for better, more predictable, and longer-term funding for education in emergencies. Alongside funding, the AWG continues to focus on promoting global EiE standards and good practices, such as the INEE Minimum Standards and the Conflict Sensitive Education Pack, as well as linking these tools to the achievement of the SDGs. Collaboratives Collaboratives consist of membership comprised of all 3 Working Groups and focus on specific thematic areas. Academic Space The Journal on Education in Emergencies (JEiE) publishes groundbreaking and outstanding scholarly and practitioner work on education in emergencies (EiE), defined broadly as quality learning opportunities for all ages in situations of crisis, including early childhood development, primary, secondary, non-formal, technical, vocational, higher and adult education. Task Teams Task teams are composed of INEE members who advocate for their thematic issue(s) and who collaboratively develop knowledge and resources to help practitioners provide inclusive, quality, and safe education for all affected by crisis.  Each task team is led by a small group of volunteer co-conveners (thematic experts with strong convening skills) and revolves around a specific set of time-bound tasks and activities. Language Communities The INEE Language Communities collate and disseminate key resources in the relevant languages, and where gaps are identified, work to develop or translate new tools and case studies.  The Language Communities also undertake advocacy and outreach in Arabic-speaking, Francophone, Hispanophone, and Lusophone countries, raising awareness about the importance of education for those affected by crisis.  Furthermore, the Language Communities support and facilitate training and capacity-building opportunities for non-Anglophone INEE Members. Reference Groups INEE Reference Groups are convened for specific topics needing expert input or guidance. Global Meet-ups INEE Meet-Up events are open and informal gatherings in all corners of the globe where INEE members and others can network, share experiences, and discuss relevant topics. Education Policy    Advocacy  Collaboratives Adolescents & Youth Task Teams Steering Group    Secretariat  Early Childhood   Gender  Inclusive Education Reference Groups Technology Standards & Practice Network Initiatives Evidence Building Working Groups E-Cubed   Arabic     French  Policy Roundtables    Spanish  Language Communities Global Consultations    Portuguese     Events  WG Meetings Global Meetups EiE Timeline    Journal EiE  INEE Website INEE Discussion Forums Listserv Webinars Social Media ANNEX 4: INEE’s Multiplier Effect Considering that INEE is comprised of more than 15,000 individual members and 130 partner organizations in more than 190 countries, INEE has the potential to impact millions of people around the world both directly and indirectly. INEE indirect beneficiaries include children, youth and their communities affected by crisis.  These assumptions can be ascertained by considering the following: INEE members typically hold positions where they are implementing field projects that can reach thousands of children and youth, such as refugee education programs, youth programs in conflict, teacher training initiatives, building of schools, school feeding programs, non-formal education programs, etc. This behavior change improves the quality of interventions. Each individual then strengthens an intervention for 500 individuals affected by crisis. 15,000 INEE members x 3 colleagues x 500 beneficiaries Additionally, one must consider the network’s 130 partner organizations who have incorporated INEE tools into their interventions targeted at the estimated 65 million children who are most directly affected by emergencies. An INEE member shares knowledge with 3 colleagues.   Those colleagues improve the quality of their interventions. 500 people in crisis contexts benefit from improved quality interventions. ANNEX 5: INEE Network Functions All of INEE's work can be classified according to one or more of the following functions: Community-Building By encouraging substantive and diverse participation, collaboration, and communication, INEE builds ties among members to promote an inclusive, mutually supportive EiE community. Convening INEE brings stakeholders together to foster dialogue, advance research to build the evidence base, and support the establishment of partnerships to work toward shared solutions. Knowledge Management INEE gathers, filters, organizes, synthesizes, and disseminates relevant information to strengthen individual and institutional capacities. Amplifying and Advocating INEE enables the voices of its members to influence change in policy and practice, and promotes new, little-known, or poorly understood ideas. Facilitationg and Learning The INEE network promotes collective action to help members develop their capacities and carry out their activities more efficiently and effectively. Providing Tools and Resources The network mobilizes and disseminates resources, materials, and opportunities that support members' work and respond to their demands.
